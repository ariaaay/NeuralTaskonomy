"""ridge.py: pytorch implementation of grid-searching ridge regression.

Ridge solutions for multiple regularization values are computed efficiently by
using the Woodbury identity. With X (n x d) representing the feature matrix, and
y (n x 1) the outcomes, the ridge solution is given by

    Î² = (X'X + l*I)^{-1}X'y

where l is the regularization coefficient. This can be reduced to

    (1/l)*(X'y - X'V(e + l*I)^{-1}(X'V)'X'y)

where Ue^{1/2}V' is the singular-value decomposition of X'. Since (e + lI) is a
diagonal matrix, its inverse can be computed efficiently simply by taking the
reciprocal of the diagonal elements. Then, (X'V)'X'y is a vector; so it can be
multiplied by (e + lI)^{-1} just by scalar multiplication.
